# Titanic-Dataset-Analysis-and-Prediction
This repository contains an analysis and prediction model for the Titanic dataset using Python. The project includes data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, and the application of machine learning models to predict survival rates.

**Project Overview**
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset that contains information about the passengers who were aboard the Titanic when it sank in 1912. The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc.

**Getting Started**
**Prerequisites**
**Make sure you have the following libraries installed:**
_pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn_
**Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:**
**Data Loading and Exploration:**
Load the Titanic dataset using pandas.
Perform initial data exploration to understand the structure and content of the data.
**Data Visualization:**
Visualize the data using matplotlib and seaborn to identify patterns and correlations.
**Data Preprocessing:**
Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Scale numerical features.
**Model Training and Evaluation:**
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression).
Evaluate model performance using accuracy score and other metrics.
**Prediction:**
Make predictions on the test set.
Evaluate the predictions using confusion matrix and classification report.
**Results**
The accuracy of the trained model on the test set is approximately 81.56%. The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics to ensure its reliability.
